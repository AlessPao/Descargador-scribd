# Express Deployment Error Fix

## Problem
The application was failing to deploy with this error:
```
TypeError: Missing parameter name at 1: https://git.new/pathToRegexpError
    at name (/opt/render/project/src/backend/node_modules/path-to-regexp/dist/index.js:73:19)
```

## Root Cause
The application was using **Express 5.1.0** (beta version) which has breaking changes and incompatibilities with the `path-to-regexp` library version 8.x used internally by Express.

## Solution
Downgraded to stable versions:
- **Express**: `5.1.0` â†’ `4.21.0` (stable)
- **Multer**: `2.0.1` â†’ `1.4.5-lts.1` (compatible with Express 4.x)

## Files Changed
1. `backend/package.json` - Updated dependencies
2. `backend/package-lock.json` - Regenerated with stable versions

## Verification
âœ… Local server starts successfully
âœ… API endpoints respond correctly
âœ… CORS configuration working
âœ… No path-to-regexp errors
âœ… Changes committed and pushed to GitHub

## Deployment Status
- **Local**: âœ… Working
- **GitHub**: âœ… Changes pushed
- **Render**: ðŸš€ Deployment in progress

## Next Steps
1. Monitor Render deployment logs
2. Verify API is accessible from frontend
3. Test full download functionality
4. Confirm CORS headers are present in production

## Technical Details
Express 5.x introduced breaking changes in route parameter handling and internal dependencies. The `path-to-regexp` library version 8.x has stricter validation that's incompatible with some Express 5.x beta features. Using Express 4.x provides a stable, well-tested foundation that works reliably across all deployment platforms.
